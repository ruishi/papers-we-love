### How To Read a Paper

Reading a paper is not the same as reading a blogpost or a novel. Here are a few handy resources to help you get started.

* [How to read an academic article](http://organizationsandmarkets.com/2010/08/31/how-to-read-an-academic-article/)
* [Advice on reading academic papers](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~akmassey/posts/2012-02-15-advice-on-reading-academic-papers.html)
* [How to read and understand a scientific paper](http://violentmetaphors.com/2013/08/25/how-to-read-and-understand-a-scientific-paper-2/)

## Contributing Guidelines

We have a few guidelines in place to keep the repo clean and easy to navigate. We recommend that you follow these conventions in your pull-request for a speedy merge. Note that every pull request we receive must have Two-Thumbs-Up minimum from PWL organizers/collaborators to be merged.

### Follow the group's ethos

We want to help bring academic research closer to practitioners and we strive to:
* **Keep the quality of papers listed high:** Books, blogposts, and/or reference pdfs don't go through the same review process that academic papers do and we won't add them to this repo.
* **Help people understand why a paper is important:** We ask that you include with your commit an update to the directory README with a short justification of why you love this paper (for example: A paper might be interesting because it spawned a new domain, it was exceptionally well-written, or perhaps it was completely wrong about something.)

### Respect content licenses

* **We will only merge pull requests that contain research papers that allow digital distribution.** Papers whose copyright prohibits redistribution will not be accepted; for example [license 1](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy-v1) from the [ACM digital library](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy).
* We encourage papers that do not allow digital distribution to be added to a README in the appropriate subject's folder. For example, [the distributed systems README](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/distributed_systems/README.md).

### Follow our naming convention

* Directory names are undercased and separated by underscores (example: artificial_intelligence)
* Paper names are undercased and separated by dashes (example: out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf). Use the full title when possible.
